## What is highShop Light?

highShop light is minified version of another project Highshop. 
    
In reality it's a clone of another high-tech e-shop but with minified design. Like his big brother the main aim is to practice PHP/Laravel, Blade, MySQL, Bootstrap...    May be you will find some excellent products with really interesting prices but keep in mind that it's fiction shop. It's one of the last project for my IT school. 

Hope you will enjoy this code!

Thank you!
